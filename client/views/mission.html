			<h2>We aim to make a Difference.</h2>
			<p>When our team thought to make Guerrilla Love, we were looking to create something that was easy to use and beneficial for our community. Guerrilla Gardening, the spontaneous act of planting, cultivating, and building a garden in a city, was a concept we'd heard of and that inspired us to take that idea further and apply to it almost anything community based. When people get motivated and just go out and DO, it's an amazing thing.</p>
			<p>Guerrilla Love's goal is to motivate people to give something back in a fun and spontaneous way. We've partnered with Uber to create a convenient way to bring people together for the better. <i class="fa fa-heart-o"></i></p>
